- price drop of previous day -> volatility spike (when looking at vol.5.past)
- difficult to interpret volatility -vs- price because of the past/future relationship of volatility for overday spreads
- intraday volatility may be more easy to interpret but requires better data

- volatility is calculated as stdev of log return, rather than stdev of close price
    - normalizes volatility - makes it independent of magnitude
