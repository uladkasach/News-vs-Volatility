- classification -vs- regression problem
    - we will not be able to achevie good performance with just news data when regressing.
        - we can predict whether the volatility will increase or decrease or stay stable based on text, but not the absolute value.
    - so:
        - evaluate regression of the documents + the original date
        - evaluate classification of increase, stable, decrease
