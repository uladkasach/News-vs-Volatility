0. generate a baseline model that attempts to predict volatility based on prior volatility
    - should be a strong baseline since papers show that volatility is autoregressive
    1. normalize data: mean =0, stdev = 1
        - note, no activation functino should be applied since vol can be greater than 1

        - LSTM:128, LSTM:32, DROPOUT:0.2, DENSE:1
            - t:30
                - [0.34, 0.33]
            - t:100
                - 0.36, 0.32
        - LSTM:32, LSTM:32, DROPOUT:0.2, DENSE:1:tanh
            - [0.34, 0.33]
        - plotting analysis of the above shows that it has captured the autoregressive phenomenon (predicts a less volatile and time delayed plot)
            - see `prediction/results/baseline_regression.previous_price.png`
0. generate baseline representations of news (see `ideas/text_rep...` for all)
    - bag of words (all, title, content)
    - tf-idf (all, title, content)
0. generate prediction pipeline on baseline representations
    - svm
        - used by [43]
    - recurrent neural network
0. assess baseline representations
0. assess autoencoder representations of news

# eventually
- assess news occurence -vs- volatility for a particular stock
- assess "event" representation of news
