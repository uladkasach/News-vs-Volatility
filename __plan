1. <s>generate market volatility data
    1. <s>grab daily data of s&p500 from yahoo
    2. <s>calculate volatility for each day for s&p500
        - prior, future, center
2. <s>inspect market returns -vs- volatility
3. <s> retrieve news data and normalize the data
    - use the dataset from [37], [38]: https://github.com/philipperemy/financial-news-dataset
    - normalize:
        1. load all data into pandas
        2. cast "date" field into readable date
        3. extract "catagory" from url of reuters news
0. <s> explore the news data
    4. <s>assess frequency of news / day
0. <s> assess news occurrence -vs- volatility
    2. see if article frequency correlates with volatility by graphing
0. label market periods as "high", "moderate", and "low" volatility
0. assess term frequency of words per region of each type of period
    - e.g., past 5 days of news, past 10 days of news, past month of news
0. generate baseline representations of news (see `ideas/text_rep...` for all)
    - bag of words (all, title, content)
    - tf-idf (all, title, content)
0. generate prediction pipeline on baseline representations
    - svm
        - used by [43]
    - recurrent neural network
0. assess baseline representations
0. assess autoencoder representations of news

# eventually
- assess news occurence -vs- volatility for a particular stock
- assess "event" representation of news
