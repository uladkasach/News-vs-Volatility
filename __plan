0. re-assess calculation of volatility
0. evaluate overlap days -vs- volatility future looking
    - ** results ** : performance is significantly affected by the overlap- as expected
        - for 5 day future volatilities, 0 overlap->great performance (0.13 MSE) where as 5 overlap (which is required to not provide info leakage) produces much worse performance (0.48 MSE)
        - for 2 day
        - for 10 day
        - for 1 day (*)
0. create baseline regressing volatility based on prior volatility + how long ago each prior volatiltiy occured
    - each datapoint in sequence is now [volatility, how_long_ago_measured]
0. create baseline predicting whether increase or decrease will occur
0. generate baseline representations of news (see `ideas/text_rep...` for all)
    - bag of words (all, title, content)
    - tf-idf (all, title, content)
0. generate prediction pipeline on baseline representations
    - svm
        - used by [43]
    - recurrent neural network
0. assess baseline representations
0. assess autoencoder representations of news

# eventually
- assess news occurence -vs- volatility for a particular stock
- assess "event" representation of news
