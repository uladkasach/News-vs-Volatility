0. generate market volatility data
    1. <s>grab daily data of s&p500 from yahoo
    2. <s>calculate volatility for each day for s&p500
        - prior, future, center
0. <s>inspect market returns -vs- volatility
0. retrieve news data and normalize the data
    - use the dataset from [37], [38]: https://github.com/philipperemy/financial-news-dataset
0. assess news occurrence -vs- volatility
    1. get reuters and bloomberg data and put into a db
    2. see if article frequency correlates with volatility by graphing

0. assess term frequency of words per region of each type of period
    - e.g., past 5 days of news, past 10 days of news, past month of news
0. generate baseline representations of news (see `ideas/text_rep...` for all)
    - bag of words (all, title, content)
    - tf-idf (all, title, content)
0. generate prediction pipeline on baseline representations
    - svm
        - used by [43]
    - recurrent neural network
0. assess baseline representations
0. assess autoencoder representations of news

# eventually
- assess news occurence -vs- volatility for a particular stock
- assess "event" representation of news
