- ** why volatility **
    -  > THE ABILITY TO FORECAST financial market volatility is important for portfolio
     selection and asset management as well as for the pricing of primary and
     derivative assets.
    - >  Finally, the predictability of volatility is important in designing optimal
     dynamic hedging strategies for options and futures (Baillie and Myers (1991)
     and Engle, Hong, Kane, and Noh (1992)). The predictability of volatility
     might also affect the results of event studies (see, for example, Connolly
     (1989)).

### [17] News—Good or Bad—and Its Impact on Volatility Predictions over Multiple Horizons

- > Overall, we find that moderately good (intra-daily) news reduces volatility (the next day), while both very good news (unusual high intra-daily positive returns) and bad news (negative returns) increase volatility, with the latter having a more severe impact.

- news does affect stocks and volatility

> It seems plausible that an increase in stock market volatility raises required stock returns, and thus lowers stock prices.
We find that volatility feedback normally has little effect on returns, but it can be important during periods of high volatility

- ***VALUE and CAPABILITY and UTILITY of predicting Volatility***
- definition of volatility
- using annual earnings report use NLP to predict market volatility for next year
    - compare with results of NLP technique + previous data (since volatility is autoregressive) to see how much NLP adds
- ~15% MSE
