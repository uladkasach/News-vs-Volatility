# Facts:
- volatility is important [19][43]
- volatility can be predicted, logically [43]
- market drop -> increased volatility [18][19] (countered by [42] ?)
- convolutional networks can misbehave with high dimensional data [38][Bengio et al., 2005]
- randomized word embeddings are used commonly for further embeddings schemes [38][Bordes et al., 2011; Jenatton et al., 2012].
- news titles are more useful for prediction compared to news contents. [37][38][ Randinsky et al. [2012]]
    - context: stock price prediction
    - *** actionalble ***
- deep neural networks work better than linear models at predicting stock trends [37]
- if predicting only individual stock based on events using all news to generate events may decrease performance [37]
- there is a one day delay between news information and stock response in most cases [37][Tetlock, Saar-Tsechansky, and Macskassy (2008)]
- it is easier to predict well known stocks based on news than less known stocks [37]
    - more data -> more accuracy
- news data can significantly affect price of a share of a security [37][Chan, 2003; Tetlock et al., 2008]
- intraday volatility must be calculated for accurate measurement of volatility for a period[19]
- volatility tends to rise  following good and bad new [41]
- market change direction can not be predicted well by volatility [44]

I have found a lot of information on why predicting market volatility is important and why it is theoretically possible ( this is something that is non-trivial as some economists question whether stock prices can actually be predicted due to the efficient market hypothesis ).

I have found lots of literature predicting volatility based on classical statistical information as well as based on new nonlinear models; in other words, there are many baselines that are available.

What is interesting is that there does not exist much literature using "news" (NLP) to predict market volatility. Some very useful papers do exist, but leave lots of questions un-answered. For the problem of predicting stock prices, however, there exists a significant number of literature which uses "news" (NLP) to predict the metric. The techniques are typically either "event" based or "sentiment" based. It will be possible to build off of these techniques for our task.

The following is a rough outline of what i think the most effective steps would be in developing a model which optimally predicts market volatility:

1. I think an interesting question that can be answered readily is in quantifying how useful simply knowing that news has been released recently is for predicting volatility. In other words, how much of volatility can be forecasted with only the dates of news reports.

2. Following this, filtering news based on how relevant classes of news topics are to the volatility can improve performance by eliminating irrelevant data.
    - e.g., news about the weather is probably not relevant in most cases to market volatility

3. After this, we can add sentiment information (using sentiment extraction on each news article) to the input features - supplementing the features generated by simply knowing how long ago the articles were released.

4. Finally, event information can be extracted from the articles and provide even more relevant information from each article.
