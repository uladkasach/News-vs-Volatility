## volatility focused:
- volatility is important [19][43]
- volatility can be predicted, logically [43]
- market drop -> increased volatility [18][19] (countered by [42] ?)
- convolutional networks can misbehave with high dimensional data [38][Bengio et al., 2005]
- randomized word embeddings are used commonly for further embeddings schemes [38][Bordes et al., 2011; Jenatton et al., 2012].
- news titles are more useful for prediction compared to news contents. [37][38][ Randinsky et al. [2012]]
    - context: stock price prediction
    - *** actionalble ***
- deep neural networks work better than linear models at predicting stock trends [37]
- if predicting only individual stock based on events using all news to generate events may decrease performance [37]
- there is a one day delay between news information and stock response in most cases [37][Tetlock, Saar-Tsechansky, and Macskassy (2008)]
- it is easier to predict well known stocks based on news than less known stocks [37]
    - more data -> more accuracy
- news data can significantly affect price of a share of a security [37][Chan, 2003; Tetlock et al., 2008]
- news has significant predictive power for volatiltiy [46]
- intraday volatility must be calculated for accurate measurement of volatility for a period[19]
- volatility tends to rise  following good and bad new [41]
- market change direction can not be predicted well by volatility [44, 47]
- volatility is autoregressive [46]
- significant news -> increased trading volume [48]
- sometimes significant news results in high volume but low change in price -> meaning that news is hard to interpret [48]
- news can be split into expected news (e.g., regular reports) and unexpected news [48]
- earnings reports are key drivers of stock prices [48]
- news released in the morning have greater impact on volatility than news released at end of day [48]
- stock market responds more to negative news than positive news [48]
- more positive news is released than negative news [48]


## data source focused
- SEC provides valuable, realtime, "pre-news" information [48]

## nn focused
- attention networks enable visualization
