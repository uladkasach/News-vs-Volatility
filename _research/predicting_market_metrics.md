- focus is on pre-processing of data to improve results
- Highlights
    - Four machine learning algorithms are used for prediction in stock markets.
    - Focus is on data pre-processing to improve the prediction accuracy.
    - Technical indicators are discretised by exploiting the inherent opinion.
    - Prediction accuracy of algorithms increases when discrete data is used.

- overview:
    - compares ANN, SVM, RF, naive-Bayes as models
    - compares two data features
        - data from computation of ten technical parameters using stock trading data
        - data from representing these technical parameters as trend deterministic data
    - results:
        - trends outperform raw data
        - random forest is best with the raw data
