on textual analysis, Decision Support Systems 50 (2011) 680–691.
- > Groth and Muntermann [11] predict intraday
market risk based on German adhoc announcements and use single
words as features. The authors are one of the few in the field to employ
Chi2
-based feature selection including exogenous market feedback.
However, accuracy values are not comparable to our work due
to a different classification task, i.e., the prediction of intraday market
risk
