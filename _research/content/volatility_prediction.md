- https://beta.vu.nl/nl/Images/werkstuk-ladokhin_tcm235-91388.pdf
- 2009
- Think Thesis style document (big)
- defines volatility and compares several approaches and datasets
- discusses its utility

***IMPORTANT DOCUMENT ***

- volatility is very important in returns and risk managment
    - see the 10 exampels
- volatility can not be accurately calculated based on daily returns
    - does not capture intra day volatility
- many error functions

- (Donaldson, 1997) shows NN can be successful at forcasting
>  (Gonzales, 1997) authors are investigating the use of Neural Networks for predicting volatility for Ibex35 index. This paper shows advantages of the non-linear Neural Networks
over the linear models for volatility forecasting.
> (Hamid, 2004) describes the usage of a feed forward Multilayer Perceptron for
forecasting the volatility of S&P 500 futures. The network uses 13 different financial
indicators as inputs, and gives the forecast for futures of different maturities
